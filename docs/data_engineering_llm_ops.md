## Data Engineering

Data Engineering focuses on managing and analyzing big data. It revolves around five key aspects:

### Volume
The size and amount of data that companies manage and analyze.

### Value
The insights and patterns derived from data that lead to business benefits.

### Variety
The diversity of data types, including unstructured, semi-structured, and raw data.

### Velocity
The speed at which data is received, stored, and managed.

### Veracity
The accuracy or truthfulness of data.

## Large Language Model Operations (LLM Ops)

The emerging field of Large Language Model Operations (LLM Ops) inherits many practices from data engineering. LLM Ops involves the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of systems using LLMs to manage and build new generation of AI powered applications.
