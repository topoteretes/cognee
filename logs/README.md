# Logs Directory

This directory contains the application logs for Cognee.

## Log Files

- Log files are named by date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.log`
- Logs are stored in plain text format with a consistent structure
- Each log entry includes:
  - Timestamp (ISO format)
  - Log level (padded to consistent width)
  - Message
  - Additional context (if any)
  - Logger name (in square brackets)
- Exception tracebacks are included for error logs

## Sample Log Entry

```
2025-03-27T13:05:27.481446Z [INFO    ] Structured log message user_id=user123 action=login status=success [TestLogger]
```

## Retention Policy

The system automatically keeps only the 10 most recent log files. Older log files are automatically deleted when new log files are created. This prevents excessive disk usage in long-running deployments.

## Usage

Logs are automatically generated by the application's logging mechanism. No manual actions are required to use this feature.

The logs directory structure is preserved in version control, but the log files themselves are gitignored.
