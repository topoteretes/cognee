The privately held company was founded in Atlanta, GA by its current management, a small group of airline pilots, in 1984.  ATP’s initial focus was providing flight training to U.S. military pilots who were seeking their Airline Transport Pilot Certificates to transition over to commercial air carrier operations.  Maintaining a focus on professional flight training, ATP later expanded its course offerings to include ab-initio training programs for both domestic and international students, seeking a career in commercial aviation.
