  "Abraham is a surname.  It can be of Jewish, English, French, German, Dutch, Irish, Welsh, Cornish, Breton, and other origins.  It is derived from the Hebrew personal name \"Avraham\", borne by the biblical patriarch Abraham, revered by Jews as a founding father of the Jewish people (Gen. 11-25), and by Muslims as founder of all Semitic peoples (see Abraham).  The name is explained in Genesis 17:5 as being derived from the Hebrew \"av hamon goyim\" \"father of a multitude of nations\".  It was commonly used as a given name among Christians in the Middle Ages, and has always been a popular Jewish given name.

  "Awithlaknannai Mosona is a two-player strategy board game from the Zuni Native American Indian tribe of New Mexico, United States.  It is unknown how old the game is.  The game was described by Stewart Culin in his book \"Games of the North American Indians Volume 2: Games of Skill\" (1907).  In this book, it was named Awithlaknan Mosona.  Awithlaknannai Mosona resembles another Zuni board game called Kolowis Awithlaknannai (Fighting Serpents) with few minor differences.  The former having a smaller board, and depending upon the variant, it also has less lines joining the intersection points.  The rules are the same.  Awithlaknannai Mosona belongs to the draughts and Alquerque family of games as pieces hop over one another when capturing.  It is actually more related to Alquerque, since the board is made up of intersection points and lines connecting them.  It is thought that the Spanish had brought Alquerque to the American Southwest, and Awithlaknannai Mosona may have been an evolution from Alquerque.  However, in Stewart Culin's 1907 book, the Zunis claim that they had adopted a hunt game from Mexico similar to Catch the Hare and the Fox games of Europe, and transformed it into Awithlaknannai Mosona.  In these games, one player has more pieces over the other, however, the other player's piece has more powers.  The Zuni's equalized the numbers of pieces and their powers, and also may have transformed the board making its length far exceed its width.  Diagonal lines also replaced orthogonal lines altogether.  However, the hunt game from Mexico may have used an Alquerque board even though the game mechanics of their new game, Awithlaknannai Mosona, were completely different.",

  "Pasang is a two-player abstract strategy board game from Brunei.  The game is often referred to as Pasang Emas which is actually a software implementation of the traditional board game.  The object of this game is to acquire the most points by capturing black and white tokens on the board.  Black tokens are worth 1 point, and white tokens are worth 2 points.  The board is initially laid out with all 120 black and white tokens in one of over 30 traditional patterns.  Players choose a piece called a \"ka\" which is used to capture the tokens on the board.

Consequently, he was the most important official in Upper Egypt after the king himself.  He has generally been equated with Heqakheperre Shoshenq II by the English Egyptologist Kenneth Kitchen and viewed as a short-lived co-regent to his father based on the Nile God British Museum statue 8 which identifies him as the son of Osorkon I and Queen Maatkare, daughter of Hor-Psusennes but this assumption is unproven.  In the statue, Shoshenq C is called \"the Master of the Two Lands\" and the formula \"beloved of Amun\" is enclosed within a royal cartouche.  However, in the text of the statue, he is not given a specific throne name or prenomen, the use of a cartouche by a royal prince is attested in other periods of Egyptian history such as that of Amenmes, son of Thutmose I, and the documents depicts Shoshenq C as a simple High Priest of Amun on the side of the legs of the Nile God, rather than a king.",

Phuket cuisine and local food (Baba Peranakan food) is the combination of many cultural food habits, whether they be Chinese, Malay or Thai.  Some Phuket local food tastes sweet, such as Chinese Hakka cuisine, but it can also be spicy, such as in Thai cuisine and Malay cuisine.",
  "Nicaraguan cuisine includes a mixture of indigenous cuisine, Spanish cuisine and Creole cuisine.  Despite the blending and incorporation of pre-Columbian and Spanish-influenced cuisine, traditional cuisine differs on the Pacific coast from the Caribbean coast.  While the Pacific coast's main staple revolves around local fruits and corn, the Caribbean coast's cuisine makes use of seafood and coconut.",
  "Despite being relatively restricted to an Atlantic sustenance, Portuguese cuisine has many Mediterranean influences.  Portuguese cuisine is famous for seafood.  The influence of Portugal's former colonial possessions is also notable, especially in the wide variety of spices used.  These spices include \"piri piri\" (small, fiery chili peppers) and black pepper, as well as cinnamon, vanilla and saffron.  Olive oil is one of the bases of Portuguese cuisine, which is used both for cooking and flavouring meals.  Garlic is widely used, as are herbs, such as bay leaf and parsley.",
  "Argentine cuisine is described as a cultural blending of Mediterranean influences (such as those created by Italian and Spanish populations) with and very small inflows (mainly in border areas), Indigenous, within the wide scope of agricultural products that are abundant in the country.  Argentine annual consumption of beef has averaged 100 kg (220 lbs) per capita, approaching 180 kg (396 lbs) per capita during the 19th century; consumption averaged 67.7 kg (149 lbs) in 2007.  Beyond \"asado\" (the Argentine barbecue), no other dish more genuinely matches the national identity.  Nevertheless, the country's vast area, and its cultural diversity, have led to a local cuisine of various dishes.  The great immigratory waves consequently imprinted a large influence in the Argentine cuisine, after all Argentina was the second country in the world with the most immigrants with 6.6 million, only second to the United States with 27 million, and ahead of other immigratory receptor countries such as Canada, Brazil, Australia, etc.",
  "Levantine cuisine is the traditional cuisine of the Levant, known in Arabic as the Bilad ash-Sham and Mashriq, which covers a large area of the Eastern Mediterranean.  It continues to carry an influentially mainstream character in a majority of the dishes today.  It is found in the modern states of Jordan, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Syria, and parts of southern Turkey near Adana, Gaziantep, and Antakya (the former Vilayet of Aleppo).  In the broader family of Mediterranean cuisine, Cypriot cuisine also has strong Levantine influences.",
  "The Niles Canyon ghost story is the Northern California variation on the vanishing hitchhiker archetype.  There are many different variations of this story depending on whom you ask.  All stories include a girl being involved in some sort of motorized vehicle accident on February 26 (year often changed).  One variation of the story includes a girl being involved in a car crash on Niles Canyon road (off the 680 freeway in Sunol, California) on the way to her prom.  The girl died on impact and to this day is said to haunt Niles Canyon road every February 26.  The tale of the haunting goes that people traveling along Niles Canyon road (now Highway 84) on the night of February 26 will see a normal-looking high school-aged girl walking along the road in a prom dress (many people have said it is white).  People traveling along the road (mostly those traveling alone) have said to have stopped and offered the girl a ride.  She accepts the ride, giving the driver an address across the bridge (either Dumbarton or Bay Bridge depending on the storyteller).  Once the driver gets to the beginning of the bridge, the girl will disappear.  Sometimes people have gone to the address to find that a girl many years ago matching that description once lived there.  Today, many people will travel along this treacherous pitch black road in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the Niles Canyon ghost.",
  "The El Ayyat train disaster happened at 02:00 on the morning of 20 February 2002 in an eleven-carriage passenger train travelling from Cairo to Luxor.  A cooking gas cylinder exploded in the fifth carriage, creating a fire which engulfed seven third-class carriages, reducing them almost to cinders.  The initial number of dead given by officials at the time was 383, all Egyptians.  However, considering that seven carriages were burnt to the ground, and each carriage was packed with at least double the maximum carrying capacity of 150, this number is considered by many people to be a great underestimate.  The dubious nature of the given death toll lies with the absence of a full passenger list; accounting for those missing was almost impossible at the time.  In addition, the fire was so intense and the carriages so badly burned that many corpses had been reduced to ash.  As there was no means of communication between the driver and the rear carriages, the driver did not know of the fire until about two hours after it had begun, resulting in many people, attempting to flee from the overcrowded carriages, jumping to their death.  Some important Egyptians have commentated that the official number of 383 dead is grossly inaccurate and was an attempt to lessen the damage done to the reputation of the government.  Many people consider a number of about 1000 deaths to be more accurate.",

  "Although spinal cord injury (SCI) often causes sexual dysfunction, many people with SCI are able to have satisfying sex lives.  Physical limitations acquired from SCI affect sexual function and sexuality in broader areas, which in turn has important effects on quality of life.  Damage to the spinal cord impairs its ability to transmit messages between the brain and parts of the body below the level of the lesion.  This results in lost or reduced sensation and muscle motion, and affects orgasm, erection, ejaculation, and vaginal lubrication.  More indirect causes of sexual dysfunction include pain, weakness, and side effects of medications.  Psycho-social causes include depression and altered self-image.  Many people with SCI have satisfying sex lives, and many experience sexual arousal and orgasm.  People with SCI employ a variety of adaptations to help carry on their sex lives healthily, by focusing on different areas of the body and types of sexual acts.  Neural plasticity may account for increases in sensitivity in parts of the body that have not lost sensation, so people often find newly sensitive erotic areas of the skin in erogenous zones or near borders between areas of preserved and lost sensation.",
  "Margarita Peak is a prominent mountain in San Diego County.  It is 9 mi southwest of Murrieta Hot Springs and 9 mi northwest of Fallbrook.  Its 3193 ft summit is the 32nd most prominent peak in San Diego County.  The trail to the peak is relatively little-used and not known by many people.  It is considered one of San Diego's greatest hidden gems, due to the breathtaking 360-degree panorama views at the top.  The main trail begins on Margarita Road after the end of Tenaja Road 13 mi southwest of I-15 and leads to nearby Margarita Lookout.  Persons attempting to reach the peak must use a steep, poorly maintained firebreak that connects to the main trail.  The hike to the top is 3 mi each way.",
  "The Kovno ghetto was a ghetto established by Nazi Germany to hold the Lithuanian Jews of Kaunas during the Holocaust.  At its peak, the Ghetto held 29,000 people, most of whom were later sent to concentration and extermination camps, or were shot at the Ninth Fort.  About 500 Jews escaped from work details and directly from the Ghetto, and joined Soviet partisan forces in the distant forests of southeast Lithuania and Belarus.",
  "Kume no Heinai-d\u014d (\u4e45\u7c73\u5e73\u5185\u5802 ) is a small folk shrine located in Asakusa in Tait\u014d, Tokyo.  The shrine houses a stone statue of Kume no Heinai, a samurai from the early Edo period (17th century).  According to the Asakusa tourism bureau, there are few facts about the life of Kume no Heinai, but he is said to have died in 1683.  Oral tradition holds that Heinai excelled in Kenjutsu, the martial art of swordsmanship, killing many people over the years.  In the latter half of his life, he is said to have lived in the Sens\u014d-ji temple in Asakusa where he devoted himself to Zen-Buddhism and held religious services in honor of the people he killed.  Shortly before his death he ordered his followers to carve his likeness on a stone and bury it near the Ni\u014dmon \u2013 the entrance to the Buddhist temple and a busy district in the city.  His wish was to have his statue be stepped on by as many people as possible in order to expiate the crimes he committed in life.  The statue was eventually retrieved and is now stored inside the shrine itself.  It is because of this that the shrine initially carried the name \"Fumitsuke\" (\u8e0f\u307f\u3064\u3051 ) , which means \"to tread on\", but over time the meaning was lost and the shrine's name came to be spelled \u6587\u4ed8\u3051, which means \"love letter\".  Both words are pronounced \"Fumitsuke\" and the shrine is now worshipped by the general public as a deity of marriage and match-making.  Kume no Heinai-d\u014d was destroyed in March 1945 during World War II.  The current temple was rebuilt in October 1978.",
  "Au\u00dfenarbeitslager Gerdauen was a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp in nowaday's Zheleznodorozhny, Kaliningrad Oblast.  Most of the prisoners in the subcamps of the Stutthoff camp contained Jewish women from Hungary and from the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Ghetto, and there were also some Jewish men from Lithuania.  While a labor camp rather than a death camp, many people died - of 100 Jewish girls at the camp only three survived the war.",
  "Karl L\u00e4rka (born 24 July 1892 at Soller\u00f6n in Dalarna, Sweden, died 2 June 1981) was one of the more important 20th-century documentary photographers in Sweden.  L\u00e4rka's prime concern was to document the peasant culture that he understood was beginning to disappear, the culture of the lands around lake Siljan in Dalarna, one with agriculture, forestry and many people with stories about older times.  Most of his photography was done from 1916 to 1934, and he combined it with lecture tours about the countryside of Siljan.  He also documented many of the stories elderly people in the villages told him and was very active in the Swedish local heritage movement that started in the 1920s.  More than 4,200 of his photographic plates are today in the municipal archive of Mora.",
  "The Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto was a World War II ghetto set up by Nazi Germany for the purpose of persecution and exploitation of local Jews in the city of Cz\u0119stochowa during the German occupation of Poland.  The approximate number of people confined to the ghetto was around 40,000 at the beginning and in late 1942 at its peak \u2013 right before mass deportations \u2013 48,000.  Most ghetto inmates were delivered by the Holocaust trains to their deaths at the Treblinka extermination camp.  In June 1943, the remaining ghetto inhabitants launched the Cz\u0119stochowa Ghetto uprising, which was extinguished by the \"SS\" after a few days of fighting."
