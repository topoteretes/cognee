Ticks also transmit numerous kinds of viruses, bacteria, and protozoa between domestic animals.  These microbes cause diseases which can be severely debilitating or fatal to domestic animals, and may also affect humans.  Ticks are especially important to domestic animals in tropical and subtropical countries, where the warm climate enables many species of ticks to flourish.  Also, the large populations of wild animals in warm countries provide a reservoir of ticks and infective microbes that spread to domestic animals.  Farmers of livestock animals use many methods to control ticks, and related treatments are used to reduce infestation of companion animals.  Veterinarians and animal health agencies work at private, national, and international scales to reduce the harm caused by ticks and their associated diseases.", "The Charles S.
