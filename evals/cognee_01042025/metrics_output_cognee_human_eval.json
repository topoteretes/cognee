The lyrics and melody are a variant of the song \"The Braes of Balquhither\" by Scottish poet Robert Tannahill (1774–1810), a contemporary of Robert Burns.  Tannahill's original song, first published in Robert Archibald Smith's \"Scottish Minstrel\" (1821–24), is about the hills (\"braes\") around Balquhidder near Lochearnhead.
