"""Linear webhook delivery verification.

Moved from cognee.modules.integrations.linear.verify_linear_signature (cognee dev,
2026-10-26) and re-expressed on the core contract: the verifier takes the raw body and the
request headers and refuses a delivery with ``WebhookVerificationError``; the FastAPI shim
cognee's generic events route needs stays in ``cognee_host/verify_linear_signature.py``.

Every inbound delivery is authenticated by a hex HMAC-SHA256 over the raw
body keyed with the app's webhook signing secret, compared against the
``Linear-Signature`` header
(https://linear.app/developers/webhooks#securing-webhooks).

The check MUST run over the raw request bytes, before any parsing —
re-serializing a parsed JSON body changes key order/escaping and breaks the
HMAC (same rule as the Slack and GitHub verifiers). Unlike GitHub, Linear
does carry replay protection: the payload's ``webhookTimestamp`` field (Unix
milliseconds) is checked against a one-minute skew window, Linear's
documented guidance. That field lives *inside* the body, so it is read only
after the HMAC has authenticated the bytes — a timestamp from an unverified
body proves nothing.
