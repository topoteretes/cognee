    answers token exchanges with JSON under a form-encoded type — and the
    response text (a ``str``) when it does not, so a caller can tell a provider
    mid-outage answering HTML from a JSON error. Neither method raises on an
    HTTP error status: the caller decides what a 4xx means, because providers
    disagree on whether a rejected exchange is a 4xx or a 200 with an error
    field. Transport failures raise the client's own exception.

    Neither method follows redirects: a redirect comes back as its own 3xx
    status. The token POST carries the client secret and the refresh token, and
    a followed 307/308 would send that body to whatever host the response names
    and hand back that host's answer.
