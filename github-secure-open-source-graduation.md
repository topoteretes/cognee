# cognee Graduates from GitHub Secure Open Source Program

*Building Trust and Security in AI Memory Systems*

We're excited to announce that **cognee** has successfully graduated from the GitHub Secure Open Source Program! This milestone reflects our commitment to maintaining the highest standards of security and reliability in open source AI infrastructure.

## What is cognee?

cognee is an open source library that provides **memory for AI agents in just 5 lines of code**. It transforms raw data into structured knowledge graphs through our innovative ECL (Extract, Cognify, Load) pipeline, enabling AI systems to build dynamic memory that goes far beyond traditional RAG systems.

### Key Features:
- **Interconnected Knowledge**: Links conversations, documents, images, and audio transcriptions
- **Scalable Architecture**: Loads data to graph and vector databases using only Pydantic
- **30+ Data Sources**: Manipulates data while ingesting from diverse sources
- **Developer-Friendly**: Reduces complexity and cost compared to traditional RAG implementations

## GitHub Secure Open Source Program Achievement

The GitHub Secure Open Source Program helps maintainers adopt security best practices and ensures that critical open source projects meet enterprise-grade security standards. Our graduation demonstrates that cognee has successfully implemented:

- **Security-first development practices**
- **Comprehensive vulnerability management**
- **Secure dependency management**
- **Code quality and review processes**
- **Community safety guidelines**

## Why This Matters for AI Development

As AI systems become more prevalent in production environments, security becomes paramount. cognee's graduation from this program means developers can confidently build AI memory systems knowing they're using infrastructure that meets rigorous security standards.

### Benefits for Our Community:
- **Enterprise Adoption**: Companies can deploy cognee with confidence in security-sensitive environments
- **Vulnerability Response**: Our security practices ensure rapid identification and resolution of potential issues
- **Supply Chain Security**: Dependencies are carefully managed and regularly audited
- **Trust & Transparency**: Open source development with security-first principles

## What's Next?

With over **5,000 GitHub stars** and a growing community of developers, cognee continues to evolve. We recently launched **Cogwit beta** - our fully-hosted AI Memory platform, and our [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24478) demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.

Our commitment to security doesn't end with graduation. We'll continue following best practices and contributing to the broader conversation about secure AI infrastructure.

## Get Started Today

Ready to add intelligent memory to your AI applications? Get started with cognee:

```python
import cognee
import asyncio

async def main():
    # Add your data
    await cognee.add("Your document content here")
    
    # Transform into knowledge graph
    await cognee.cognify()
    
    # Query intelligently
    results = await cognee.search("What insights can you find?")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

asyncio.run(main())
```
