Neptune Analytics is an ideal choice for investigatory, exploratory, or data-science workloads 
    that require fast iteration for data, analytical and algorithmic processing, or vector search on graph data. It 
    complements Amazon Neptune Database, a popular managed graph database. To perform intensive analysis, you can load 
    the data from a Neptune Database graph or snapshot into Neptune Analytics. You can also load graph data that's 
    stored in Amazon S3.
