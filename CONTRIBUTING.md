## 5. Developer Certificate of Origin
All contributions to the topoteretes codebase must be signed-off to indicate you have read and agreed to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), which is in the root directory under name DCO. To sign the DCO, simply add -s after all commits that you make, to do this easily you can make a git alias from the command line, for example:

$ git config alias.cos "commit -s"

Will allow you to write git cos which will automatically sign-off your commit. By signing a commit you are agreeing to the DCO and agree that you will be banned from the topoteretes GitHub organisation and Discord server if you violate the DCO.

We consider the following as violations to the DCO:

Signing the DCO with a fake name or pseudonym, if you are registered on GitHub or another platform with a fake name then you will not be able to contribute to topoteretes before updating your name;
Submitting a contribution that you did not have the right to submit whether due to licensing, copyright, or any other restrictions.
