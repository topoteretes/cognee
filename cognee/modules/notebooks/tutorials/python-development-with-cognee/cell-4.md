# Data Used in This Tutorial

Cognee can ingest many types of sources. In this tutorial, we use a small, concrete set of files that cover different perspectives:

- `guido_contributions.json` — Authoritative exemplars. Real PRs and commits from Guido van Rossum (mypy, CPython). These show how Python’s creator solved problems and provide concrete anchors for patterns.
- `pep_style_guide.md` — Norms. Encodes community style and typing conventions (PEP 8 and related). Ensures that search results and inferred rules align with widely accepted standards.
- `zen_principles.md` — Philosophy The Zen of Python. Grounds design trade‑offs (simplicity, explicitness, readability) beyond syntax or mechanics.
- `my_developer_rules.md` — Local constraints Your house rules, conventions, and project‑specific requirements (scope, privacy, Spec.md). Keeps recommendations relevant to your actual workflow.
- `copilot_conversations.json` — Personal history. Transcripts of real assistant conversations, including your questions, code snippets, and discussion topics. Captures “how you code” and connects it to “how Guido codes.”
