# First Data Ingestion: Exploring Guido's Python Contributions

We'll begin with a document that contains detailed PRs and commits from Guido van Rossum's work on mypy and CPython, showing real-world examples of Python's creator solving type system and language design challenges.

We'll use Cognee's `add()` and `cognify()` functions to ingest this data and build a knowledge graph that connects Guido's development patterns with Python best practices.
