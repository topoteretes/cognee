    Find the neighbours of a given node in the graph and return their descriptions.
    Supports both NetworkX graphs and Neo4j graph databases based on the configuration.

    Parameters:
    - graph (Union[nx.Graph, AsyncSession]): The graph object or Neo4j session.
    - query (str): Unused in this implementation but could be used for future enhancements.
    - infrastructure_config (Dict): Configuration that includes the graph engine type.
    - other_param (dict, optional): A dictionary that may contain 'node_id' to specify the node.

    Returns:
    - Dict[str, str]: A dictionary containing the unique identifiers and descriptions of the neighbours of the given node.
