    Filter nodes based on a condition (such as containing 'SUMMARY' in their identifiers) and return their summary attributes.
    Supports both NetworkX graphs and Neo4j graph databases based on the configuration.

    Parameters:
    - graph (Union[nx.Graph, AsyncSession]): The graph object or Neo4j session.
    - query (str): The query string to filter nodes by, e.g., 'SUMMARY'.
    - infrastructure_config (Dict): Configuration that includes the graph engine type.
    - other_param (str, optional): An additional parameter, unused in this implementation but could be for future enhancements.

    Returns:
    - Dict[str, str]: A dictionary where keys are node identifiers containing the query string, and values are their 'summary' attributes.
