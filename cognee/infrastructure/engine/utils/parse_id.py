def parse_id(id: any):
    """
    Parse the input ID and convert it to a UUID object if it is a valid string
    representation.

    If the input is not a string or if the string cannot be converted to a UUID, return the
    input unchanged. This function catches exceptions that may arise from invalid string
    formats during conversion, but does not raise those exceptions further.

    Parameters:
    -----------

        - id (any): The input ID, which can be of any type and may be a string
          representation of a UUID.

    Returns:
    --------

        The original input ID if it is not a string or cannot be converted to a UUID;
        otherwise, a UUID object if the conversion is successful.
