"""Example usage of the LM Studio adapter in Cognee.

This script demonstrates how to use the LM Studio adapter for various tasks.
Before running, make sure:
1. LM Studio is installed and running
2. The API server is started in LM Studio
3. A model is loaded in LM Studio

Usage:
    python -m cognee.infrastructure.llm.lm_studio.example
