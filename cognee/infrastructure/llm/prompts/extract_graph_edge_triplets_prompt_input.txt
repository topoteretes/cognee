Using provided potential nodes and relationships, extract concrete edges from the following text. Build upon previously extracted nodes and edges (if any), as this is round {{ round_number }} of {{ total_rounds }}.

**Text:**
{{ text }}

**Potential Nodes to Use:**
{{ potential_nodes }}

**Potential Relationships to Use:**
{{ potential_relationship_names }}

**Previously Extracted Nodes:**
{{ previous_nodes }}

**Previously Extracted Edge Triplets:**
{{ previous_edge_triplets }}

Create specific edge triplets between nodes, ensuring each connection is clearly supported by the text content. Use the potential nodes and relationships as your primary building blocks, while considering previously extracted nodes and edges for consistency and completeness.
