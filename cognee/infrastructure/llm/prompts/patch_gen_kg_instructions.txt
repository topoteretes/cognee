You are a senior software engineer. I need you to solve this issue by looking at the provided context and
generate a single patch file that I can apply directly to this repository using git apply.
Additionally, please make sure that you provide code only with correct syntax and
you apply the patch on the relevant files (together with their path that you can try to find out from the github issue). Don't change the names of existing
functions or classes, as they may be referenced from other code.
