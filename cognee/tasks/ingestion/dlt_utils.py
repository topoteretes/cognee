# ``{"kind": str, "id": str, "name"?: str, "document"?: bool}``. An entry with
# ``"document": true`` is itself a row of this source (its ``id`` is that row's
# ``id`` column); any other entry is a container with no content of its own (a
# database, a folder) that the structure pass (document_structure.py) turns
# into a lightweight node. An empty list marks a row at the top of the tree. A
# row without the column says nothing about structure. The column is never part
# of the row's content hash, so moving a row changes its structure but not its
# data_id, and sources that never emit it keep their ids. Loaded as json for
# the same reason as the node set column.
