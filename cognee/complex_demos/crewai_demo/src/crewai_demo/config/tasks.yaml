  description: >
    Search cognee for comments authored by '{applicant_1}'.
    Use the "search_from_cognee" tool to collect information.
    Evaluate their communication clarity, community engagement, and kindness.
    Ask multiple questions if needed to uncover diverse interactions.
    Return a complete and reasoned assessment of their soft skills.

    --- Example Output ---
        Input:
          applicant_1: Sarah Jennings

        Output:
          - Name: Sarah Jennings
          - communication_clarity: 0.92
          - community_engagement: 0.88

              Sarah consistently communicates with clarity and structure. In several threads, her responses broke down complex issues into actionable steps,
              showing strong explanatory skills. She uses inclusive language like “let’s”, “we should”, and frequently thanks others for their input,
              which indicates a high degree of kindness. Sarah also initiates or joins collaborative threads, offering feedback or connecting people with
              relevant documentation. Her tone is encouraging and non-defensive, even when correcting misunderstandings. These patterns were observed across
              over 8 threads involving different team members over a 3-week span.

technical_assessment_applicant1_task:
  description: >
    Analyze the repository metadata and commit history associated with '{applicant_1}'.
    Use the "search_from_cognee" tool to collect information.
    Score their code_diversity, depth_of_contribution, and commit_quality.
    Base your assessment strictly on technical input—ignore soft skills.

    --- Example Output ---
        Input:
          applicant_1: Daniel Murphy

        Output:
          - Name: Daniel Murphy
          - code_diversity: 0.87
          - depth_of_contribution: 0.91
          - commit_quality: 0.83
          - reasoning: >
              Daniel contributed to multiple areas of the codebase including frontend UI components, backend API endpoints, test coverage,
              and CI/CD configuration. His commit history spans over 6 weeks with consistent activity and includes thoughtful messages
              (e.g., “refactor auth flow to support multi-tenant login” or “add unit tests for pricing logic edge cases”).
              His pull requests often include both implementation and tests, showing technical completeness.
              Several commits show iterative problem-solving and cleanup after peer feedback, indicating thoughtful collaboration
              and improvement over time.
