    "# Neptune Analytics as Hybrid Graph/Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "Cognee.ai supports Neptune Analytics as a hybrid adaptor: providing both graph and vector storage. This allows cognee to use the same storage medium for graph-based queries and vector-similarity searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to connect to an Amazon Neptune Analytics instance using the Cognee.ai configuration, which uses AWS Langchain and boto3 under the hood to connect to the AWS service.\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the general installation of Cognee.ai, you will need an Amazon Neptune Analytics instance running with access.\n",

    "# Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Amazon Neptune Analytics Instance Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an Amazon Neptune Analytics instance in your AWS account following the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune-analytics/latest/userguide/get-started.html). Please note you will also need to configuration the following:\n",
    "- Under `Network and Security` | `enable public connectivity`, allow your graph to be reachable over the internet if accessing from outside a VPC.\n",
    "- Under `Vector search settings` | `Vector search dimension configuration` | `Use vector dimension`. The Neptune Analytics instance must be created using the same vector dimensions as the embedding model creates. See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/neptune-analytics/latest/userguide/vector-index.html. For example, if using OpenAI LLM `openai/text-embedding-3-small`, which uses 1536-dimension embeddings, your Neptune Analytics vector store must be configured to accept 1536-dimension vectors.\n",
    "- Once the Amazon Neptune Analytics instance is available, you will need the graph-identifier to connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Attach Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Configure your AWS credentials with access to your Amazon Neptune Analytics resources by following the [Configuration and credentials precedence](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/v1/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html#configure-precedence). You can do this by declaring environment variables in your `.env` file in the project root directory and importing dotenv.\n",

    "export AWS_NEPTUNE_ANALYTICS_GRAPH_ID=g-your-graph\n",
    "```\n",
